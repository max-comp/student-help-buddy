Problem to be solved 

The project aims to tackle poor time management among students,
which often leads to procrastination, missed deadlines, and stress.
The solution will help students manage their time effectively by providing tools
like timers and checklists that keep them on track. 

  

Summary of the Project solution 

The "Student Help Buddy" project offers a comprehensive time management tool that includes features
such as a student timer, a checklist, and toggle switches for student activities. This solution allows
students to visually and interactively manage their tasks, ensuring that they stay focused and productive. 




  
List of Project Requirements   

Student Timer: Interaction, screen, buzzer for notifications.  

Checklist: Interaction and screen for visualizing tasks.  

Student Toggle: LED, interaction, screen, and on/off switch to enable or disable tasks.  

Other Equipment: On/off switch for the overall system. 

 

 


 

Initial Design  

![StudentBuddy concept01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ea302d8-9d1e-49ea-9c73-642cccb9f1f2)

Testing approach ‚Äì how did you plan your software and hardwaretesting as well as evidence of tests carried out. 

Testing software--
We sadly couldn't efficiently test the software due to only finding the correct LCD screen type on a virtual service called wokwi later on

Thankfully as this project continues we can get more adept at it and use all it's functionalities

Testing hardware--
Testing hardware was also inefficient due to only having access to the arduino yuns during class times

It was still very possible and during these times I was able to measure and 3D print the casing and assemble the parts during class to test it out üëç

Security measures--

Blynk Cloud has multiple layers of security, it means our network security was already
protected sufficiently on the network side.
Every user should have a valid email address.

A explanation from Blynk itself:
"Blynk offers a built-in verification process Each device has its own unique OAuth token and Product ID.
A combination of both these fields grants access to the device only for your organization "

We also created a rigid enough casing - the design is made easy to assembe and disassemble,
due to the limitation of only being able to access the arduino y√∫ns code



Future improvements planned and potential next steps in developing the idea further
